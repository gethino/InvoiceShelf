/**
 * dompdf does not use a declared `line-height` directly. It scales it by the
 * font's own height:
 *
 *     rendered = declared × (ascent + descent) / unitsPerEm × font_height_ratio
 *
 * The bundled Noto Sans reports 1.362 for that middle term, so at dompdf's stock
 * font_height_ratio of 1.1 every line-height in every document came out 1.4985×
 * what the CSS asked for. Chromium honours the declared value exactly, and that
 * single factor was the whole vertical disagreement between the two drivers --
 * measured at ~100pt across a page before this, and under 10pt on most templates
 * after.
 *
 * config/dompdf.php sets the ratio to 1/1.362 to cancel the font term. The
 * invariant that buys is simply: the font's reported height equals the font
 * size, so a declared length is rendered at that length.
 *
 * This is calibrated against Noto Sans. Swap the default face, or take a dompdf
 * upgrade that changes the computation, and this fails rather than quietly
 * reintroducing the drift.
